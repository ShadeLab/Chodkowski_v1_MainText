## Abstract
Microbial exponential growth is expected to occur infrequently in environments with long periods of nutrient starvation punctuated by short periods of high nutrient flux. These conditions likely impose non-growth states for microbes. However, non-growth states are uncharacterized for the majority of environmental bacteria, especially in regard to exometabolite production. We compared exometabolites produced over time in stationary phase across three environmental bacteria: Burkholderia thailandensis E264 (ATCC 700388), Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 31532, and Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC3000 (ATCC BAA-871). We grew each strain in monoculture and investigated exometabolite dynamics over time from mid-exponential to stationary phase. We focused on exometabolites that were released into the media and accumulated over 45 hours, including approximately 20 hours of stationary phase. We also analyzed transcripts (RNA-seq) to interpret exometabolite output. We found that a majority of exometabolites released were strain-specific, with a subset of identified exometabolites involved in both central and secondary metabolism. Transcript analysis supported that exometabolites were released from intact cells, as various transporters had either increased or consistent transcripts through time. Interestingly, we found that all strains released succinate, and that each strain re-routed their metabolic pathways involved in succinate production during stationary phase. Overall, these results show that non-growth states can be metabolically dynamic, and that environmental bacteria can enrich a minimal medium environment with diverse chemical compounds as a consequence of growth and post-growth maintenance in stationary phase. This work has implications for understanding microbial community interactions via exometabolites, where growth cessation or growth limitation is prevalent.
