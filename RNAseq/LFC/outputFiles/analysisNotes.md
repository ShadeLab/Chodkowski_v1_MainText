# Note: Need to run lfc_analysis.R to obtain these files
The outputs are three large .RData files containing objects from lfc_analysis.R

The files are too large to upload to GitHub. < /b>
If you've cloned the repository, lfc_analysis.R should save .RData here < /b>
Then, you can continue with the analysis > KeggPathwayAnalysis.R < /b>
